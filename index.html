        <h2 class="Center">Rain Patterns over the years</h2>
        <p>There are no clear trends for the rain data over the years at least based off these visualizations, this is because of the high year on year deviations of the data.  However what these visualizations do a good job at showing is the periods of exceptionaly high and low raifall in the state as can be seen on the graph. The Federation drought, Big Dry, along with the wettest year in 1973 and the driest in 1967 can be easily seen along with even more.  Given most of the stations have not been opperational for the duration of the timeframe the data from each point is not going to be the most reliable however it is still very good.</p>

        <h2 class="Center">Rain Patterns over the state</h2>
        <p>The rainfall over the state ccen be seen to fluctuate in a sinysoidal pattern over the months, this is as would be expected as the seasons bring with them the rainfall.  As can be seen in the below map there is substantialy more of the rainfall concentrated over the east of the state, this is located on the mountainous alpine areas, places that would intuitivly promote higher rainfall, given the mountains inhibit the ability of clouds to pass.  On the other hand the north western side of the state has far below the state average of rain, this is the region of the state that trends towards desert as can be seen.  This map shows the optimal locations for amy catchments or areas that would want higher rainfall such as farmers or dams.</p>
